# HitmanRandomizer
A program that will generate a random Hitman loadout

HOW TO USE: Simply download the program and run it. It's a basic python file so it should work, but if it doesn't you may need to install the latest version of python from https://www.python.org

This randomizer assumes you have every unlockable item and suit available in Hitman III. It also gives you the option of enabling items that are no longer unlockable, such as the Trinity Pack and the Explosive Pen.

Future work will go into allowing more customization (such as disabling certain DLCs, only randomizing content from a specific game, potentially even allowing the user to remove items without editing the source code)

Thanks for viewing, happy hunting!
