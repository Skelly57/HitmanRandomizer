# HitmanRandomizer
A program that will generate a random Hitman loadout

HOW TO USE: Simply download the program and run it. It's a basic python file so it should work, but if it doesn't you may need to install the latest version of python from https://www.python.org

This randomizer assumes you have every unlockable item and suit available in Hitman: World of Assassination. It also gives you the option of enabling items that are no longer unlockable, such as the Trinity Pack and the Explosive Pen.

You can also generate a full campaign with a randomized loadout for each level. Future work will go into allowing the user to remove certain items that they may not have, preventing them from being drawn during randomization. 

Thanks for viewing, happy hunting!
