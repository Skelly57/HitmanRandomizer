# HitmanRandomizer
A program that will generate a random Hitman loadout

HOW TO USE: Simply download the program and run it. It's a basic python file so it should work, but if it doesn't you may need to install the latest version of python
from https://www.python.org

This randomizer assumes you have every unlockable item and suit available in Hitman III. It does not include items stuck in Hitman 2 such as the performance coins,
aluminium briefcase, or Florida Fit with Gloves. If you have those items, or are missing items, feel free to edit the lists in the python file to match your inventory.
Happy hunting!
